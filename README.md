# S3 Demand based individual project 

This is a repository containing code and all documentation for individual project for semester 3 course based.

This project's main purpose is to find a practical real-life problem, research it and try to forge a viable solution for it.

## Problem

The problem I've chosen for this project is a very common one and very quite simple but can be particularly annoying. I'm talking about going to a restaurant of caffe bar and waiting for a waiter to make your order. I personally have experienced this problem in restaurants during summer, but this can be translated to any type of service based catering facility.

Few possible solutions come to mind, but none are really economic or profitable.

First one is to get more staff. Scaling horizontally isn't the worst way to tackle this, but it is definitely a subpar approach. More staff there is, more money needs to be spent every year on salaries and taxes.

Another course of action is to just scale down the number of potential customers, e.g. reduce the number of tables. This is obviously inferior approach to previous one because it is self-limiting and therefore profits are limited due to the number of potential clients. But because there are less clients at any given time, staff can be more focused and customer experience can be greatly improved.

My proposal for the solution is a modern one, it is to digitalize the whole customer experience, from ordering the food to paying the bill. My proposal suggests that customer does not need to wait for staff to come, bring menus and then order when staff comes again. Customer can sit at the table, take a look at the menu, order at their own tempo without being pressured all on their mobile devices  . In the middle of the meal they can call a staff member if they desire so and at the end pay for the meal either digitally or with cash.
